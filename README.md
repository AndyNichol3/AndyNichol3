## Project Focus

🔭 **Project Spotlight: AI Minesweeper Bot**

### Minesweeper AI Bot

🤖 My primary project for the time being: Dive into my [Minesweeper AI Bot](https://github.com/AndyNichol3/Minesweeper-Bot) - a C++ Minesweeper clone with an AI bot that plays my clone of the game.

🎮 **Features:**
- **AI Bot Integration:** Experience an AI bot playing Minesweeper autonomously.
- **Under Development:** This project is continually evolving.
- **Interactive Mode:** Users can take control if the bot halts or needs assistance.

### Terminal Minesweeper Clone

🕹️ Additionally, explore the [original Minesweeper repository](https://github.com/AndyNichol3/MineSweeperCpp) without the AI bot.

Feel free to explore these projects, and your feedback is highly valued!
